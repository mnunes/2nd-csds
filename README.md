# How to simplify your statistical reports using RMarkdown

This course will be a practical introduction on how to create a reproducible workflow using RMarkdown. The participants will see how they can create tidy reports merging R code and their conclusions. There will be data analysis exercises where reports will be written by the participants, showing them how to create their own reports.

This short course was a part of the scientific programming of the [Second Conference on Statistics and Data Science](http://www.csds2019.ime.ufba.br/), on 18-20 November 2019.
